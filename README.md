In order to run this file you need to open up the terminal and run npm start.
If dependencies need to be installed before running nom start you need to run npm install.

The app is responsive, on small screen you get the column with the list of task, remove btn and you can mark task as completed.
On larger screen I added the optional "due date" option plus an edit button. I added the edit button because at the beginning I just mistakenly thought it was needed and then I felt too bad to take it off therefore I left it on larger screen.
