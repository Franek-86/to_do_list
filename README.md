# How to run the project

In order to run this project you need to open the terminal and run "npm install" first as I cancelled the "node_modules" before zipping the file.

Once installed them you can start the project by running "npm start".

# Project description

The app is full responsive, on small screen the table is made of three columns: a list of tasks, a remove btn and a checkbox where you can mark the tasks as completed.
On larger screen I added the optional "due date" option plus an edit button. I added the edit button because at the beginning I just mistakenly thought it was needed and then it felt too bad to take it off.
